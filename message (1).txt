        <h1>About the Bot</h1>
        <p>
          Our bot is a powerful all-in-one Discord tool created to enhance
          server management, automation, and community engagement. Designed with
          both server owners and moderators in mind, it offers a wide range of
          features including advanced moderation commands, automated role
          systems and systems like ticket support, custom logging, anti-spam
          filters, and much more are coming soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're running a gaming server, community hub, or support
          server, our bot is tailored to help you stay organized, protected, and
          active.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bot is online 24/7 thanks to a reliable uptime system, and we are
          constantly improving its functionality based on community feedback.
          New features and improvements are rolled out regularly, making the bot
          smarter, faster, and more useful with every update.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using our bot, users agree to follow a set of guidelines designed
          to protect the integrity of the service and the communities it
          supports. Below are our <a href="#terms">Terms of Service</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="terms">
        <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 3rem; border-bottom: none">
          Terms of Service
        </h1>

        <h1>Usage Agreement</h1>
        <p>
          You may only use the bot in accordance with Discord’s Terms of Service
          and Community Guidelines. Abusing the bot’s features, attempting to
          exploit its commands, or using it for malicious purposes (e.g., raids,
          spam, harassment) is strictly prohibited.
        </p>

        <h1>Data Collection</h1>
        <p>
          The bot may collect limited server data such as user IDs, message
          content (for moderation/logging), and command usage for the purpose of
          functionality and moderation. We do not sell or share this data, and
          it is only used internally to improve performance and ensure smooth
          operation.
        </p>

        <h1>Availability</h1>
        <p>
          While we strive for 99.9% uptime, we do not guarantee 24/7 access due
          to maintenance, updates, or unforeseen outages. Users will be notified
          in our support server in the case of extended downtime.
        </p>

        <h1>Support and Liability</h1>
        <p>
          We are not responsible for damages caused by misuse of the bot or
          third-party abuse. We will do our best to patch vulnerabilities
          quickly and provide active support, but the ultimate responsibility
          lies with the server owner and moderators.
        </p>

        <h1>Termination of Access</h1>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to deny or remove access to the bot at any time,
          for any reason, especially in cases of abuse, violation of terms, or
          threats to the system.
        </p>

        <h1>Updates to Terms</h1>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the
          bot after updates means you agree to the new terms. Changes will
          always be announced on our website or support server.
        </p>
